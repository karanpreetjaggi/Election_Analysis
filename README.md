## Election-Audit Summary
Similar methodolgy can be used to calculate which states have highest number of votes.  
We can also use political parties that got the highest number of votes.
Declare variable based on the requirements. Eg-use political paties instead of candidates and use states in pleace of county. Based on the new variable we can build a new code keeping in mind that the basis of the code can be very much similar to the initial code we used.
